  <li>  <b>Work:</b> HTML that explains my past projects in paragraphs, images, and media. </li>
  <li> <b>Invest:</b> Backend (Python) that grabs the latest dataset from YFinance for a list of tickers in a .txt file, and sends the <i>JsonResponse</i> to the Frontend (Java) that displays the dataset on a CanvasJS chart. </li>
  <li> <b>Work:</b> HTML/CSS that shows some of my designs and personal work.</li>
</ul>
